The ongoing challenge of managing the
COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate predictions of
daily new cases to inform healthcare resource allocation
and public health policy. This study employs data mining
techniques to analyse a rich dataset containing COVID19 case statistics by region, demographic groups, and
vaccination status. Using regression and time-series
forecasting methods, the goal is to predict the number of
daily new cases. The analysis involves data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and
validation to derive insights and ensure robust
predictions. Results indicate that incorporating lag
features, vaccination status, and cluster data improves
forecasting accuracy, demonstrating the potential of data
mining in pandemic management.
